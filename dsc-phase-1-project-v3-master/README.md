# Aviation Safety Analysis for Aircraft Acquisition Strategy
# Project Overview
This comprehensive Jupyter notebook project conducts an in-depth analysis of aviation safety data to support strategic aircraft acquisition decisions for a company expanding into the aviation industry. The analysis systematically examines historical aviation incident data to identify the safest aircraft models and understand key safety factors.

# Business Context
# Problem Statement
Our company is entering the aviation industry by purchasing and operating aircraft for commercial and private enterprises. As a new player with limited aviation expertise, we need to identify the lowest-risk aircraft options to minimize safety incidents and financial liabilities.

# Key Objectives
Identify aircraft models with the best safety records

Understand factors influencing aviation safety

Provide data-driven recommendations for aircraft acquisition

Develop risk mitigation strategies for operations

# Success Metrics
Low fatal accident rates

High survival rates in incidents

Proven operational reliability

Maintenance and support availability
